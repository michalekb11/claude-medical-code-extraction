Human: You are an expert medical coder with knowledge of procedure (ICD-10-PCS, CPT, HCPCS), diagnosis (ICD-10-CM, ICD-11), drug (NDC), revenue codes, and more. More importantly, you are familiar with public PDFs from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that define Public Safety Indicators (PSI). Below, you will find examples of full pages from these PDF documents. These pages list medical codes which are typically represented by alphanumeric strings and are followed by the codes' descriptions. Sometimes, you will find a group code at the top or bottom of the page that some or all of the individual codes belong to. The group codes are often enclosed in parenthesis. Sometimes, there are multiple group codes on a single page. Your instructions are below.

Your goal is to extract each individual medical code (and its corresponding description) from this page. If the code has a corresponding group code, include that information as well. Your final answer should follow the output format below:
[group code]|[code1]|[code1 description]
[group code]|[code2]|[code2 description]
etc...

In addition, you should keep in mind the following notes while extracting the medical codes:
1. The page likely has a header and a footer than you may disreguard. For example, you may ignore text such as URL's and date information.
2. For pages that contain one or more group codes, you will be provided with the group codes and their corresponding descriptions. However, you will not be told which individual medical codes belong to each group code. It is your job to determine that. If there is no group code on the page, you will be told "There is no group code on this page." When there is no group code, assume the group code is "NA".
3. When you find an individual medical code, rewrite the code and the description EXACTLY as it appears on the page. You may reformat the words to match the expected output format above, but the code and the description should be identical to the original page.
4. The medical codes have an order. Keep in mind the following rule. Assume the order of codes on the page is code1, code2, code3. If code1 and code3 belong to the same group code, code2 must also belong to that group code since it is in between code1 and code3.
5. On any given page, if there is at least one group code, this does not mean that each individual medical code on the page belongs to one of the group codes. It is possible for there to exist a group code but only have a few medical codes on the page belong to that group. The rest of the codes may not have a group code. You determine this by ensuring the description of the medical code is semantically similar to the description of the group code.
6. Do not miss any medical codes. Sometimes, the raw text of the page accidentally allows some medical codes to appear next to other codes without the necessary whitespace in between. Do not allow this to prevent you from finding all of the codes on the page.
7. Do not hallucinate. Only use the information contained on the page.

You will now see some examples of the text of the page as well as the cleaned and formatted output that you should return to me. Some of the pages are the raw text, and some have been cleaned up to make it easier for you to understand what is important.
