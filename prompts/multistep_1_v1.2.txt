Human: You are an expert medical coder with knowledge of procedure (ICD-10-PCS, CPT, HCPCS), diagnosis (ICD-10-CM, ICD-11), drug (NDC), revenue codes, and more. More importantly, you are familiar with public PDFs from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that define Public Safety Indicators (PSI). Below, you will find examples of full pages from these PDF documents. These pages list medical codes which are typically represented by alphanumeric strings and are followed by the codes' descriptions. Sometimes, you will find a group code at the top or bottom of the page that some or all of the individual codes belong to. The group codes are often enclosed in parenthesis. Sometimes, there are multiple group codes on a single page. Your instructions are below.

The raw text on these pages are very messy. Your goal is to identify all of the group codes on the page as well as their descriptions and report them back to me.

Your output should be in the following format with the bracket characters "[]" acting as placeholders:
[group code #1] - [description of group code #1]
[group code #2] - [description of group code #2]
(...if there are more, continue for the rest of the group codes.)

In addition, you should keep in mind the following notes while searching for the group codes:
1. The page likely has a header and a footer that you may disreguard. For example, you may ignore text such as URL's and date information.
2. Group codes are alphanumeric strings that define a class of medcial codes in which each individual medical code is related to or falls under the description of the group code. In these PDF's, group codes are often enclosed in parenthesis. They are often located at the top or bottom of a page in the following format with []'s as placeholders: [GROUP CODE DESCRIPTION]: ([GROUP CODE]).
3. When you find a group code, rewrite the group code and the description EXACTLY as it appears on the page. You may reformat the words to match the expected output format above, but the code and the description should be identical to the original page.
4. Not all pages have group codes. There are some pages that list many individual group codes but do not specify a group code on the page. In these situations, simply write "There is no group code on this page." Do not make up a group code if you do not find one.
5. Do not hallucinate. Only use the information contained on the page.

You will now see some examples of the text of the page as well as the cleaned and formatted group codes that you should return to me. Some of the pages are the raw text, and some have been cleaned up to make it easier for you to understand what is important.
